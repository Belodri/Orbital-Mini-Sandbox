# Technical Architecture

## WebApp Architecture

The WebApp is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using PIXI.js for rendering. It provides the user interface and orchestrates the simulation by communicating with the C# `EngineBridge`.

### Design Principles
- **Separated State Ownership**: The architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns for state management:
    - The C# `PhysicsEngine` is the exclusive source of truth for all physics-related data (mass, position, velocity, simulation time, etc).
    - The JavaScript `WebApp` is the exclusive source of truth for all application-level metadata (body names, colors, UI configuration).
- **Orchestration, Not Duplication**: The `WebApp` does not duplicate the core physics state. It orchestrates the simulation by issuing commands to the `EngineBridge` and reads physics data back for rendering and state management.
- **History Management**: The `WebApp` owns and manages the undo/redo history. It accomplishes this by fetching full-state presets from the engine, managing them in its own history stacks, and loading them back into the engine as needed.

### UI Components
**SimulationControls (left sidebar)**
Vertically collapsible container with horizontally collapsible individual subsections
- **Simulation Options:** play/pause, time scaling, time navigation, gravitational constant adjustment
- **Visualization Options:** visual rendering options (orbit paths, velocity trails, labels, body scale), and background color customization
- **Presets:** import/export UI, input validation & error handling
- **Hotkey** static reference

**BodiesList (right sidebar)**
Vertically collapsible container with an interactive list of all celestial bodies.
Each item on the list displays the body's name and has the following buttons:
- **Focus:** focuses the camera on this body; highlighted if active
- **Configure:** opens the body's `BodyConfig` component or brings it to the front if already open
- **Details:** opens the body's `BodyDetails` component or brings it to the front if already open
- **Delete:** handles body deletion with confirmation dialog 
Additionally, the `BodiesList` component handles
- list sorting and search
- **Create** button: creates a new (default disabled) body and opens its `BodyConfig` component

**BodyConfig**
Moveable & collapsible overlay that provides detailed configuration interface for a single celestial body
- Handles validated input for body property modifications
- Manages form validation and error display

**BodyDetails**
Moveable & collapsible overlay that displays detailed read-only information of a single celestial body

**Canvas**
The central PIXI.js component for all rendering.
- Subscribes to high-frequency tick events and updates the visual representation of the system
- Manages camera logic (zoom, pan, focus tracking)
- always below all other components

### Classes

`AppShell`
- **Singleton** orchestrator for the entire application.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Instantiates and holds references to all core components (`EngineInterface`, `CanvasView`, all UI components).
    - Manages the creation, destruction, and layering of UI overlays (`BodyConfig`, `BodyDetails`).
    - Binds global keyboard shortcuts and delegates corresponding actions to the `EngineInterface`.

`EngineInterface`
- **Singleton** facade that abstracts all communication with the `EngineBridge`. It is the only module in the `WebApp` permitted to call into the C# code.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - **Command Issuing:** Translates user actions from the UI into specific, low-frequency commands sent to the `EngineBridge` (e.g., `updateBody`, `setTimeScale`).
    - **History Management:**
        - Implements the `undo()` and `redo()` methods.
        - Before issuing a state-changing command, it first calls `engineBridge.getPreset()` to retrieve the current physics state. It combines this with its own application metadata to form a complete snapshot string.
        - This snapshot is pushed onto an `undoStack`. The `undo()`/`redo()` methods manage these stacks and use them to restore a previous state.
        - To restore a state, it parses the snapshot string, loads the physics portion into the engine via `engineBridge.loadPreset()`, updates its own application metadata, and then emits a global event to notify all UI components of the change.
    - **Rendering Loop & Data Transformation:**
        - Manages the `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
        - In each frame, it calls `engineBridge.tick()`. After the tick, it reads the raw physics data from a private typed array view over the WASM shared memory.
        - It transforms this raw data into a structured, user-friendly `engineData` object, which it exposes to the rest of the app. This process maps the flat buffer data into a nested object structure and can include calculated derived values (e.g., acceleration).
        - Finally, it emits a `tick` event, providing the updated `engineData` to all subscribers.
    - **Data Exposure:** Provides clean, read-only access to the application's complete state via two structured properties:
        - `engineData`: A nested object containing all physics-related data for the current tick. This is rebuilt every frame.
        - `metaData`: A map containing all non-physics UI metadata for each body. This persists across ticks.
- **State Ownership:**
    - `undoStack`: `string[]`
    - `redoStack`: `string[]`
    - `metaData`: `Map<[bodyId: number], {name: string, color: string, ...}>`
    - `engineData`: `{simulationTime: number, bodiesData: Map<[bodyId: number], {...}>}`
    - A **private** typed array view over the WASM shared memory buffer.

**Example Data Structures Exposed by `EngineInterface`:**
```js
engineData = { 
    simulationTime: 12345, 
    bodiesData: new Map([
        [28142348, { 
            enabled: true, 
            mass: 5.972e24, 
            position: { x: 1.496e11, y: 0 }, 
            velocity: { vx: 0, vy: 29780 },
            derived: {
                acceleration: { ax: -5.93e-3, ay: 0 }
            }
        }]
    ]) 
};

metaData = new Map([
	[28142348, {
		name: 'Earth',
		color: '#3a72d6'
    }]
]);
```

`CanvasView`
- Encapsulates all rendering logic using PIXI.js.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Initializes the `PIXI.Application` and attaches it to the DOM.
    - Subscribes to tick notifications from the `EngineInterface` and consumes the structured `engineData` and `metaData` objects.
    - Renders the simulation by efficiently updating the properties of PIXI.js display objects based on the provided data.
    - Manages all camera logic (zoom, pan, focus tracking).
- **State Ownership:**
    - The `PIXI.Application` instance.
    - A `Map<[bodyId: number], PIXI.DisplayObject>` linking body IDs to their visual representations.
    - Current camera state.

## EngineBridge Architecture
The `EngineBridge` serves as the critical communication layer between the JavaScript `WebApp` and the C# `PhysicsEngine`, leveraging Blazor WebAssembly's interop capabilities. It manages the `PhysicsEngine` lifecycle, coordinates data flow through shared memory, and provides a stable JavaScript-callable API surface.

### Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: The `EngineBridge` maintains the authoritative `PhysicsEngine` instance and delegates all physics operations to it
- **Performance-Optimized Communication**: High-frequency data (physics state) flows through shared WASM memory buffers, while low-frequency operations (commands) use direct interop calls
- **Stateless Facade**: The bridge itself maintains minimal state, serving primarily as a coordinator and translator between the WebApp and PhysicsEngine domains
- **Error Boundary**: All C# exceptions are caught and transformed into JavaScript-friendly error responses

### Shared Memory Architecture
The `EngineBridge` implements a dual-buffer system for efficient data transfer:

**SimStateBuffer** - General simulation metadata
```
[byte tickError, double simulationTime, float timeScale, byte timeDirection, int bodyCount]
```

**BodyStateBuffer** - Continuous array of body data blocks
```
Per body: [int id, byte enabled, double mass, double posX, double posY, double velX, double velY, ...]
```

_Note: Additional derived properties (acceleration, orbital elements, etc.) will be appended to this layout as physics requirements are determined during development._

**Memory Management Rules**
- `EngineBridge` has exclusive write access to shared buffers
- `WebApp` has read-only access to shared buffers
- Buffers are updated synchronously after each `PhysicsEngine.Tick()`
- Buffer sizes are pre-allocated based on maximum body count (configurable, default: 1000 bodies)

### API Surface
The `EngineBridge` exposes the following `[JSInvokable]` methods to the WebApp
```csharp
// Simulation Control
[JSInvokable] public void Tick() // Performance critical - errors communicated via tickError flag in SimStateBuffer
[JSInvokable] public string GetTickErrorText() // Returns detailed error message from last failed Tick()
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<bool> SetTimeScale(float timeScale)
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<bool> SetTimeDirection(bool forward)
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<bool> SetSimulationTime(double time)

// Preset Management  
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<string> GetPreset()
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<bool> LoadPreset(string presetData)

// Body Management
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<int> CreateBody(double mass, double posX, double posY, double velX, double velY)
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<bool> UpdateBody(int id, double mass, double posX, double posY, double velX, double velY)
[JSInvokable] public EngineResult<bool> DestroyBody(int id)

// Memory Buffer Access
[JSInvokable] public int GetSimStateBufferPointer()
[JSInvokable] public int GetBodyStateBufferPointer()
[JSInvokable] public string GetBodyStateBufferLayout() // Returns JSON configuration object describing buffer structure
```

**Standardized Result Structure**
```csharp
public struct EngineResult<T>
{
    public bool Success { get; set; }
    public string ErrorMessage { get; set; } // Empty string on success
    public T Value { get; set; }
}
```

### Classes
`EngineBridge`
- **Singleton** coordinator that serves as the primary JavaScript interop surface
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Manages the lifecycle of the `PhysicsEngine` instance
    - Translates JavaScript method calls into appropriate `PhysicsEngine` API calls
    - Coordinates the `MemoryBufferHandler` to update shared memory after physics operations
    - Implements comprehensive error handling and transforms C# exceptions into JavaScript-consumable error messages
    - Provides shared memory buffer pointers to the JavaScript layer
- **State Ownership:**
    - `PhysicsEngine` instance (composition)
    - `MemoryBufferHandler` instance (composition)
    - Last tick error message (for on-demand retrieval)

`MemoryBufferHandler`
- Specialized component responsible for efficient shared memory management
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Allocates and manages the dual shared memory buffer system
    - Synchronizes physics engine state into shared buffers after each tick
    - Maintains buffer metadata (sizes, pointers, layouts)
    - Handles buffer overflow scenarios gracefully
- **State Ownership:**
    - `SimStateBuffer`: Fixed-size buffer for simulation metadata
    - `BodyStateBuffer`: Dynamic buffer for celestial body data
    - Buffer configuration parameters (max bodies, buffer sizes)

### Buffer Layout Configuration
The `EngineBridge` provides dynamic buffer layout information to enable flexible development and reduce coupling between C# and JavaScript implementations.

**BodyStateBuffer Layout Object**
```json
{
  "stride": 7,
  "fields": {
    "0": { "name": "id", "type": "int32" },
    "1": { "name": "enabled", "type": "uint8" },
    "2": { "name": "mass", "type": "float64" },
    "3": { "name": "posX", "type": "float64" },
    "4": { "name": "posY", "type": "float64" },
    "5": { "name": "velX", "type": "float64" },
    "6": { "name": "velY", "type": "float64" }
  }
}
```

_Additional fields will be appended with higher indices as derived properties are implemented._

This configuration allows the `WebApp` to dynamically parse buffer data without requiring synchronized updates to both codebases during development.

**Command Flow (Low Frequency):**
1. `WebApp` calls `[JSInvokable]` method on `EngineBridge`
2. `EngineBridge` validates input parameters
3. `EngineBridge` translates call to appropriate `PhysicsEngine` method
4. `PhysicsEngine` executes operation and returns result
5. `EngineBridge` catches any exceptions, formats response, and returns to JavaScript
6. `MemoryBufferHandler` updates shared buffers if physics state changed

**Tick Flow (High Frequency):**
1. `WebApp` calls `EngineBridge.Tick()`
2. `EngineBridge` calls `PhysicsEngine.Tick()`
3. `PhysicsEngine` completes physics calculations
4. `EngineBridge` calls `MemoryBufferHandler.UpdateBuffers()`
5. `MemoryBufferHandler` queries `PhysicsEngine` for current state
6. `MemoryBufferHandler` writes structured data to shared memory buffers
7. `WebApp` reads updated buffer data directly from memory

### Error Handling Strategy
**Performance-Optimized Tick Error Handling**
- `Tick()` method uses shared memory flag for error communication to avoid serialization overhead
- `tickError` flag in SimStateBuffer indicates if the last tick failed
- Detailed error messages are retrieved on-demand via `GetTickErrorText()`
- WebApp checks `tickError` before processing physics data and can pause simulation with user-friendly error display

**Rich Error Handling for Commands**
- All non-performance-critical methods return `EngineResult<T>` struct
- Provides success flag, detailed error message, and return value in a single response
- Enables comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Exception Translation**
- All C# exceptions are caught at the `EngineBridge` boundary
- Physics validation errors return descriptive error messages
- System exceptions return generic error indicators
- No exceptions propagate to the JavaScript layer

**Graceful Degradation**
- Invalid operations return error responses but don't crash the simulation
- Critical tick errors pause the simulation with error display rather than silent failure
- Memory allocation failures trigger cleanup and retry mechanisms

**Error Communication**
- Tick errors: communicated via `tickError` flag + on-demand error text retrieval
- Command errors: structured `EngineResult<T>` responses with detailed messages
- `WebApp` determines how to handle errors and their user-facing display

## PhysicsEngine Architecture
The physics engine is designed as a double-buffered, completely UI-agnostic, self-contained system that provides a clean API boundary for external integration. This separation ensures the computational physics logic remains independent of presentation concerns and can be thoroughly tested in isolation. 
### API
The PhysicsEngine is accessed by initializing the exposed `PhysicsEngine` class. This class exposes the following methods.
```c#
// Presets
public string GetPreset(); // takes a snapshot of the current state of the Simulation and transforms it intro a string

public bool LoadPreset(string preset); // takes a preset string and creates a new Simulation instance from it which replaces the current simulation instance; returns true if successful, or false if not


// Simulation Time
public void Tick(); // ticks the simulation once

public void SetSimulationTime(int time); // sets the simulation time 

public int GetSimulationTime(); // gets the simulation time

public void SetTimeScale(float timescale);  // sets the timescale for the simulation

public float GetTimeScale();  // gets the timescale for the simulation

public void SetTimeForward(bool isForward); // sets the direction of time for the simulation

public bool GetTimeForward(); // gets the direction of time for the simulation


// Celestial Bodies
public record CelestialBodyData(int Id, bool Enabled, double Mass, Vector2 Position, Vector2 Velocity); // I might need to add other properties to this record as CelestialBody also has derived properties like certain orbital values for example. I don't yet know which ones though.

public int? CreateBody(double Mass, Vector2 Position, Vector2 Velocity); // creats a CelestialBody instance and adds it to the simulation; is always initiaized with enabled=false and a unique id; the unique id is returned. If the given data was invalid, returns null instead;

public void DestroyBody(int id); // destroys an existing CelestialBody by its id;

public CelestialBodyData? GetBodyData(int id); // gets the data of an existing CelestialBody instance by its id; If none exists retunrs null instead;

public CelestialBodyData[] GetBodyDataAll(); // gets the data of all existing CelestialBody instances

public int? UpdateBody(CelestialBodyData newData); // updates an existing CelestialBody; the unique id is returned. If the given data was invalid, returns null instead; 
```

### PhysicsEngine.Tick() workflow
Core workflow when Tick() is called on an instance of PhysicsEngine
1. `PhysicsEngine` Enables syncLock (also prevents further PhysicsEngine.Tick() calls)
2. `PhysicsEngine` Calls simulation.Tick()
3. `Simulation` Gets int deltaTime = timer.GetDeltaTime()
4. `Timer` Calculates deltaTime from simulationTime, timeScale, and timeDirection and returns the result
5. `Simulation` calls grid.rebuild(bodies)
6. `Simulation` creates a tempBodiesRef variable and assigns it a reference to bodies  
7. `Simulation` sets bodies = prevBodies  
8. `Simulation` sets prevBodies = tempBodiesRef
9. `Simulation` creates calculator = new Calculator(deltaTime, grid, prevBodies); arguments are readonly;
10. `Simulation` loops over bodies, filters out disabled ones, calls calculator.evaluate(body) for each; can be parallelized safely
11. `Calculator` calculates the changes to the given body and mutates it
12. `Simulation` calls timer.updateTime(deltaTime) which updates the simulationTime and thus advances the tick
13. `PhysicsEngine` Disables syncLock
