# Overview
**Orbital Mini-Sandbox** is a 2D, top-down simulation of simplified orbital mechanics that runs entirely in a web browser using a C#-based physics engine compiled to WebAssembly. The application is designed to function as an interactive "what-if" engine for celestial systems, allowing users to visually explore the basic principles of gravity. Users can create and modify these systems, for example by adding a new planet to a model of our solar system or by doubling the Earth's mass, and immediately observe the resulting impact on the orbits and stability of the entire system.

# Technical Architecture

## WebApp Architecture

The WebApp is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using PIXI.js for rendering. It provides the user interface and orchestrates the simulation by communicating with the JavaScript API of `Bridge`.

### Design Principles
- **Separated State Ownership**: The architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns for state management:
    - The C# `Physics` is the exclusive source of truth for all physics-related data (mass, position, velocity, simulation time, etc).
    - The JavaScript `WebApp` is the exclusive source of truth for all application-level metadata (body names, colors, UI configuration).
- **Orchestration, Not Duplication**: The `WebApp` does not duplicate the core physics state. It orchestrates the simulation by issuing commands to the `Bridge` and accesses physics data for rendering.
- **History Management**: The `WebApp` owns and manages the undo/redo history. It accomplishes this by fetching full-state presets from the engine, managing them in its own history stacks, and loading them back into the engine as needed.

### UI Components
**SimulationControls (left sidebar)**
Vertically collapsible container with horizontally collapsible individual subsections
- **Simulation Options:** play/pause, time scaling, time navigation, gravitational constant adjustment
- **Visualization Options:** visual rendering options (orbit paths, velocity trails, labels, body scale), and background color customization
- **Presets:** import/export UI, input validation & error handling
- **Hotkey** static reference

**BodiesList (right sidebar)**
Vertically collapsible container with an interactive list of all celestial bodies.
Each item on the list displays the body's name and has the following buttons:
- **Focus:** focuses the camera on this body; highlighted if active
- **Configure:** opens the body's `BodyConfig` component or brings it to the front if already open
- **Details:** opens the body's `BodyDetails` component or brings it to the front if already open
- **Delete:** handles body deletion with confirmation dialog 
Additionally, the `BodiesList` component handles
- list sorting and search
- **Create** button: creates a new (default disabled) body and opens its `BodyConfig` component

**BodyConfig**
Moveable & collapsible overlay that provides detailed configuration interface for a single celestial body
- Handles validated input for body property modifications
- Manages form validation and error display

**BodyDetails**
Moveable & collapsible overlay that displays detailed read-only information of a single celestial body

**Canvas**
The central PIXI.js component for all rendering.
- Drives the render loop and updates the visual representation of the system
- Manages camera logic (zoom, pan, focus tracking)
- always below all other components

### Classes

`AppShell`
- **Static** orchestrator for the entire application.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Instantiates and/or holds references to all core components (Javascript API of `Bridge`, `AppDataManager`, `CanvasView`, all UI components).
    - Manages the creation, destruction, and layering of UI overlays (`BodyConfig`, `BodyDetails`).
    - Binds global keyboard shortcuts and delegates corresponding actions to the `Bridge` or to other parts of the `WebApp`.
    

`AppDataManager`
- Owner and handler of application level metadata.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - **Data Handling:** 
        - Maintains a `Map<number, object>` which maintains application-level metadata for each celestial body in the simulation.
    - **Snapshot Management:**
        - Calls the `getPreset()` method of the `Bridge` to retrieve the current physics state which it then combines with its own application metadata to form a complete snapshot string.
        - To restore a state, it parses the snapshot string, loads the physics portion into the engine via `engineBridge.loadPreset()`, and updates its own application metadata.
- **State Ownership:**
    - **metaData**: An object containing application-level metadata

`CanvasView`
- Encapsulates all rendering logic using PIXI.js.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Initializes the `PIXI.Application` and attaches it to the DOM.
    - Directly manages the main `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
    - Consumes the structured data from the `AppDataManager` and `Bridge` JS API.
    - Renders the simulation by efficiently updating the properties of PIXI.js display objects based on the provided data.
    - Manages all camera logic (zoom, pan, focus tracking).
- **State Ownership:**
    - The `PIXI.Application` instance.
    - Current camera state.

## Bridge Architecture

The `Bridge` serves as the critical communication layer between the JavaScript `WebApp` and the C# `Physics`, leveraging WebAssembly's interop capabilities. It manages the `Physics` lifecycle, coordinates data flow through shared memory, and provides a stable JavaScript API surface.

### Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: The `Bridge` maintains the authoritative `Physics` instance and delegates all physics operations to it
- **Performance-Optimized Communication**: High-frequency data (physics state) flows through shared WASM memory buffers, while low-frequency operations (commands) use direct interop calls
- **Stateless Facade**: The bridge itself maintains minimal state, serving primarily as a coordinator and translator between the `WebApp` and `Physics` domains
- **Error Boundary**: All C# exceptions are caught and handled as errors on the JavaScript side

### Project Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ EngineBridge.cs                 # C# coordinator
â”œâ”€â”€ MemoryBufferHandler.cs          # Shared Memory manager

â”œâ”€â”€ wwwroot/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bridge.js                   # JS coordinator
â””â”€â”€ types/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Bridge.d.ts                 # Type information for the JS Bridge class
    â”œâ”€â”€ LayoutRecords.d.ts          # Auto-generated type information for the simulation properties
    â””â”€â”€ dotnet.d.ts                 # .NET type information for the DotNetHostBuilder
```

### Shared Memory Architecture
The `EngineBridge` implements a double/float64 dual-buffer system for efficient data transfer:
- **SimStateBuffer**: General simulation data and buffer metadata
- **BodyStateBuffer**: Continuous array of body data blocks

The single source of truth for the layout of these buffers are the records in `LayoutRecords.cs`. This ensures a self-configuring layout on both the C# and the JavaScript sides.

**Memory Management Rules**
- `Bridge` has exclusive write access to shared buffers
- `WebApp` has read-only access to shared buffers
- Buffers are updated synchronously after each `Physics.Tick()`
- Buffer sizes are pre-allocated based on maximum body count (configurable, default: 1000 bodies)

### API Surface
The `Bridge` exposes a Javascript API (`bridge.mjs`) to the WebApp. The API's type definitions can be found in `types/Bridge.d.ts`
```typescript
static initialize(): Promise<void>

static tickEngine(timestamp: number): BodyDiffData;

static setTimeScale(timeScale: number): void;
static setTimeDirection(isForward: bool): void;

// Preset Management  
static getPreset(): string;
static loadPreset(enginePreset: string): void;

// Body Management
static createBody(Partial<BodyStateData>): number;
static updateBody(Partial<BodyStateData>): number;
static deleteBody(bodyId: number): void;

BodyDiffData: {
    created: Set<number>,
    updated: Set<number>,
    deleted: Set<number>,
}
```

### Components

`bridge.mjs`
- **Static** coordinator that serves as the sole external-facing API surface
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Abstracts away and hides the implementation details of the C# <-> JavaScript boundry
    - Provides a clean surface for `WebApp` to interact with
    - Efficiently reads from the shared memory buffers and provides primitive differential update data
- **State Ownership:**
    - `simState`: The Javascript representation of the current simulation state

`EngineBridge.cs`
- **Static** coordinator that serves as the sole JavaScript interop surface
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Manages the lifecycle of the `PhysicsEngine` instance
    - Translates JavaScript method calls into appropriate `Physics` API calls
    - Coordinates the `MemoryBufferHandler` to update shared memory after physics operations
    - Implements comprehensive error handling and transforms C# exceptions into JavaScript-consumable error messages
- **State Ownership:**
    - `PhysicsEngine` instance (composition)
    - `MemoryBufferHandler` instance (composition)

`MemoryBufferHandler.cs`
- Specialized component responsible for efficient shared memory management
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Allocates and manages the dual shared memory buffer system
    - Synchronizes physics engine state into shared buffers after each tick
    - Maintains buffer metadata (sizes, pointers, layouts)
    - Avoids buffer overflow scenarios through automatic resizing
- **State Ownership:**
    - `SimStateBuffer`: Fixed-size buffer for simulation metadata
    - `BodyStateBuffer`: Dynamic buffer for celestial body data
    - Buffer configuration parameters (max bodies, buffer sizes)

**Tick Flow:**
Javascript
1. `WebApp` calls `Bridge.tickEngine()`
2. `Bridge` (JS) calls `EngineBridge.Tick()` (C#)

C#
3. `EngineBridge` calls `PhysicsEngine.Tick()`
4. `PhysicsEngine` completes physics calculations
5. `EngineBridge` calls `MemoryBufferHandler.WriteTickData()`
6. `EngineBridge` (C#) returns null to `Bridge` (JS) to indicate success, or an error string on a failure

Javascript
7. `Bridge` 
    - throws an error if an error string was received
    - reads from memory and refreshes the exposed `simState` object
    - returns an simple diff to `WebApp`

### Error Handling Strategy
**Exception Translation**
- All C# exceptions are caught at the `EngineBridge` boundary. Their messages are used to create new JavaScript Error objects, which are then thrown on the JavaScript side, ensuring no raw C# objects leak across the interop boundary.
- Physics validation errors return descriptive error messages
- System exceptions return generic error indicators
- No exceptions propagate to the JavaScript layer

**Graceful Degradation**
- Invalid operations return error responses but don't crash the simulation
- Critical tick errors pause the simulation with error display rather than silent failure
- Memory allocation failures trigger cleanup and retry mechanisms

## PhysicsEngine Architecture
The physics engine is designed as a double-buffered, completely UI-agnostic, self-contained system that provides a clean API boundary for external integration. This separation ensures the computational physics logic remains independent of presentation concerns and can be thoroughly tested in isolation.

### API
The PhysicsEngine is accessed by initializing the exposed `PhysicsEngine` class. This class exposes the following methods.
```c#
// Presets
public string GetPreset(); // takes a snapshot of the current state of the Simulation and transforms it intro a string

public bool LoadPreset(string preset); // takes a preset string and creates a new Simulation instance from it which replaces the current simulation instance; returns true if successful, or false if not


// Simulation Time
public TickDataDto Tick(double timestamp); // ticks the simulation once

public void SetSimulationTime(double time); // sets the simulation time 

public void SetTimeScale(double timescale);  // sets the timescale for the simulation

public void SetTimeForward(bool isForward); // sets the direction of time for the simulation

// DTOs
public record BodyStateData(int Id, bool Enabled, double Mass, double PosX, double PosY, double VelX, double VelY); // I might need to add other properties to this record as CelestialBody also has derived properties like certain orbital values for example. I don't yet know which ones though.

public record SimStateData(double SimulationTime, double TimeScale, bool IsTimeForward);

public record TickDataDto(SimStateData SimStateData, BodyStateData[] BodiesStateData);

// Celestial Bodies

public int CreateBody(); // creats a CelestialBody instance and adds it to the simulation; is always initiaized with enabled=false, a unique id, and default values; the unique id is returned.

public void DestroyBody(int id); // destroys an existing CelestialBody by its id;

public BodyStateData? GetBodyData(int id); // gets the data of an existing CelestialBody instance by its id; If none exists retunrs null instead;

public BodyStateData[] GetBodyDataAll(); // gets the data of all existing CelestialBody instances

public int? UpdateBody(BodyStateData newData); // updates an existing CelestialBody; the unique id is returned. If the given data was invalid, returns null instead; 
```

### PhysicsEngine.Tick() workflow
Core workflow when Tick(timestamp) is called on an instance of PhysicsEngine
1. `PhysicsEngine` Enables syncLock (also prevents further PhysicsEngine.Tick() calls)
2. `PhysicsEngine` Calls simulation.Tick(timestamp)
3. `Simulation` Gets double deltaTime = timer.GetDeltaTime(timestamp)
4. `Timer` Calculates deltaTime from timestamp, simulationTime, timeScale, and timeDirection and returns the result
5. `Simulation` calls grid.rebuild(bodies)
6. `Simulation` creates a tempBodiesRef variable and assigns it a reference to bodies  
7. `Simulation` sets bodies = prevBodies  
8. `Simulation` sets prevBodies = tempBodiesRef
9. `Simulation` creates calculator = new Calculator(deltaTime, grid, prevBodies); arguments are readonly;
10. `Simulation` loops over bodies, filters out disabled ones, calls calculator.evaluate(body) for each; can be parallelized safely
11. `Calculator` calculates the changes to the given body and mutates it
12. `Simulation` calls timer.updateTime(deltaTime) which updates the simulationTime and thus advances the tick
13. `PhysicsEngine` Disables syncLock
