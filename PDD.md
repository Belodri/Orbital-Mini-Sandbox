# Overview
**Orbital Mini-Sandbox** is a 2D, top-down simulation of simplified orbital mechanics that runs entirely in a web browser using a C#-based physics engine compiled to WebAssembly. The application is designed to function as an interactive "what-if" engine for celestial systems, allowing users to visually explore the basic principles of gravity. Users can create and modify these systems, for example by adding a new planet to a model of our solar system or by doubling the Earth's mass, and immediately observe the resulting impact on the orbits and stability of the entire system.

# Technical Architecture

## WebApp Architecture

The WebApp is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using PIXI.js for rendering. It provides the user interface and orchestrates the simulation by communicating with the JavaScript API of `Bridge`.

### Design Principles
- **Separated State Ownership**: The architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns for state management:
    - The C# `Physics` is the exclusive source of truth for all physics-related data (mass, position, velocity, simulation time, etc).
    - The JavaScript `WebApp` is the exclusive source of truth for all application-level metadata (body names, colors, UI configuration).
- **Orchestration, Not Duplication**: The `WebApp` does not duplicate the core physics state. It orchestrates the simulation by issuing commands to the `Bridge` and accesses physics data for rendering.
- **History Management**: The `WebApp` owns and manages the undo/redo history. It accomplishes this by fetching full-state presets from the engine, managing them in its own history stacks, and loading them back into the engine as needed.

### UI Components
**SimulationControls (left sidebar)**
Vertically collapsible container with horizontally collapsible individual subsections
- **Simulation Options:** play/pause, time scaling, time navigation, gravitational constant adjustment, and other simulation parameters & constants
- **Visualization Options:** visual rendering options (orbit paths, velocity trails, labels, body scale), and background color customization
- **Presets:** import/export UI, input validation & error handling
- **Hotkey** static reference

**BodiesList (right sidebar)**
Vertically collapsible container with an interactive list of all celestial bodies.
Each item on the list displays the body's name and has the following buttons:
- **Focus:** focuses the camera on this body; highlighted if active
- **Configure:** opens the body's `BodyConfig` component or brings it to the front if already open
- **Details:** opens the body's `BodyDetails` component or brings it to the front if already open
- **Delete:** handles body deletion with confirmation dialog 
Additionally, the `BodiesList` component handles
- list sorting and search
- **Create** button: creates a new (default disabled) body and opens its `BodyConfig` component

**BodyConfig**
Moveable & collapsible overlay that provides detailed configuration interface for a single celestial body
- Handles validated input for body property modifications
- Manages form validation and error display

**BodyDetails**
Moveable & collapsible overlay that displays detailed read-only information of a single celestial body

**Canvas**
The central PIXI.js component for all rendering.
- Drives the render loop and updates the visual representation of the system
- Manages camera logic (zoom, pan, focus tracking)
- always below all other components

**Notifications**
A dedicated container area for displaying temporary, non-modal status messages to the user (e.g., "Preset Loaded").
- Provides a simple `add(message)` API for other components to display information.
- Manages a message queue to gracefully handle bursts of notification requests.
- Automatically manages the lifecycle of notification DOM elements, adding them to the view and removing them after a configured duration.
- Implements a performance-optimized render loop using debouncing and intelligent scheduling to minimize processing and DOM manipulation.


### Core Components

`main.mjs`
- Application entry point & handler of fatal errors.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Serves as the sole script entry point, loaded directly by `index.html`.
    - Initiates the application by calling `AppShell.initialize()` on window load.
    - Acts as a global safety net, catching unhandled exceptions and promise rejections.
    - Displays a static fatal error message to the user if the application encounters an unrecoverable state, preventing a blank or broken page.

`AppShell`
- Static orchestrator for the entire application.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Instantiates and/or holds references to all core components (Javascript API of `Bridge`, `AppDataManager`, `CanvasView`, `Notifications`, all other UI components).
    - Manages the creation, destruction, and layering of UI overlays (`BodyConfig`, `BodyDetails`).
    - Binds global keyboard shortcuts and delegates corresponding actions.
    - Orchestrates the command and data flow between `Bridge` and all other components.
    - **Snapshot Management:**
        - Calls the `getPreset()` method of the `Bridge` to retrieve the current physics state which it then combines with `AppDataManager`'s preset data to form a complete snapshot string.
        - To restore a state, it parses the snapshot string, loads the physics portion into the engine via `engineBridge.loadPreset()`, and the metadata portion via `appDataManager.loadPresetData()`.

`AppDataManager`
- Owner and handler of application level metadata. Dumb and fully decoupled. 
- **Responsibilities:**
    - **Data Handling:** 
        - Maintains a `Map<number, object>` which maintains application-level metadata for each celestial body in the simulation.
        - Handles updates to metadata as instructed by `AppShell`, queue-based updates to existing bodies.
- **State Ownership:**
    - **metaData**: An object containing application-level metadata
    - **updateQueue**: A store of queued updates for the metadata (last-write-wins system)

`CanvasView`
- Encapsulates all rendering logic using PIXI.js. Dumb and fully decoupled. 
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Initializes the `PIXI.Application` and attaches it to the DOM.
    - Signals `AppShell` whenever an animation frame is ready.
    - Renders the simulation by efficiently updating the properties of PIXI.js display objects from injected data as instructed.
    - Manages all camera logic (zoom, pan, focus tracking).
- **State Ownership:**
    - The `PIXI.Application` instance.
    - Current camera state.

---

## Bridge Architecture

The `Bridge` serves as the critical communication layer between the JavaScript `WebApp` and the C# `Physics`, leveraging WebAssembly's interop capabilities. It manages the `Physics` lifecycle, coordinates data flow through shared memory, and provides a stable JavaScript API surface.

### Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: The `Bridge` maintains the authoritative `Physics` instance and delegates all physics operations to it
- **Performance-Optimized Communication**: High-frequency data (physics state) flows through shared WASM memory buffers, while low-frequency operations (commands) use direct interop calls
- **Stateless Facade**: The bridge itself maintains minimal state, serving primarily as a coordinator and translator between the `WebApp` and `Physics` domains
- **Error Boundary**: All C# exceptions are caught and handled as errors on the JavaScript side

### Project Structure
```
Bridge/
â”œâ”€â”€ EngineBridge.cs                 # C# coordinator
â”œâ”€â”€ MemoryBufferHandler.cs          # Shared Memory manager
â”œâ”€â”€ LayoutRecords.cs                # SSOT for shared memory buffer layout

â”œâ”€â”€ wwwroot/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bridge.js                   # JS coordinator
â””â”€â”€ types/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Bridge.d.ts                 # Type information for the JS Bridge class
    â”œâ”€â”€ LayoutRecords.d.ts          # Auto-generated type information for the simulation properties
    â””â”€â”€ dotnet.d.ts                 # .NET type information for the DotNetHostBuilder
```

### Shared Memory Architecture
The `EngineBridge` implements a double/float64 dual-buffer system for efficient data transfer:
- **SimStateBuffer**: Static, general simulation data and buffer metadata
- **BodyStateBuffer**: Dynamic, continuous array of body data blocks

The single source of truth for the layout of these buffers are the records in `LayoutRecords.cs`. This ensures a self-configuring layout on both the C# and the JavaScript sides.

**Memory Management Rules**
- `Bridge` has exclusive write access to shared buffers
- `WebApp` has read-only access to shared buffers
- Buffers are updated synchronously after each time step or in demand-adjusted intervals to process queued write operations.
- Buffer sizes are pre-allocated based on maximum body count (configurable, default: 10 bodies)

### API Surface
The `Bridge` exposes a Javascript API (`bridge.mjs`) to the WebApp. The API's type definitions can be found in `types/Bridge.d.ts`
```typescript
static initialize(): Promise<void>

static tickEngine(): BodyDiffData;
static updateEngine(Partial<EngineStateData>): Promise<void>;

// Preset Management  
static getPreset(): string;
static loadPreset(enginePreset: string): BodyDiffData;

// Body Management
static createBody(Partial<BodyStateData>): Promise<number>;
static updateBody(Partial<BodyStateData>): Promise<boolean>;
static deleteBody(id: number): Promise<boolean>;

BodyDiffData: {
    created: Set<number>,
    updated: Set<number>,
    deleted: Set<number>,
}
```

### Components

`Bridge.mjs`
- **Static** coordinator that serves as the sole external-facing API surface
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Abstracts away and hides the implementation details of the C# <-> JavaScript boundry
    - Provides a clean surface for `WebApp` to interact with
    - Efficiently reads from the shared memory buffers and provides primitive differential update data
- **State Ownership:**
    - `simState`: The Javascript representation of the current simulation state

`EngineBridge.cs`
- **Static** coordinator that serves as the sole JavaScript interop surface
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Manages the lifecycle of the `PhysicsEngine` instance
    - Translates JavaScript method calls into appropriate `Physics` API calls
    - Coordinates the `MemoryBufferHandler` to update shared memory after physics operations
- **State Ownership:**
    - `PhysicsEngine` instance (composition)
    - `MemoryBufferHandler` instance (composition)
    - `CommandQueue` instance (composition)

`MemoryBufferHandler.cs`
- Specialized component responsible for efficient shared memory management
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Allocates and manages the dual shared memory buffer system
    - Synchronizes physics engine state into shared buffers after each tick
    - Maintains buffer metadata (sizes, pointers, layouts)
    - Avoids buffer overflow scenarios through automatic resizing
- **State Ownership:**
    - `SimStateBuffer`: Fixed-size buffer for simulation metadata
    - `BodyStateBuffer`: Dynamic buffer for celestial body data
    - Buffer configuration parameters (max bodies, buffer sizes)

`CommandQueue.cs`
- Specialized utility class that decouples immediate method calls from their execution by queuing them as commands.
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Enqueues PhysicsEngine operations for deferred, batched execution.
    - Abstracts the creation and lifecycle of Task<T> objects (which are marshaled to JavaScript Promises) for commands that must return a value.
    - Manages promise resolution, ensuring tasks are correctly completed with a result or rejected with an exception upon command execution.
    - Executes all pending commands when processed by the EngineBridge (such as during a tick).
    - Allows the queue to be cleared to prevent stale operations after a full state reset (e.g., LoadPreset).
- **State Ownership:**
    - A Queue of Action<PhysicsEngine> delegates representing the pending commands.

**Tick Flow:**
Javascript
1. `WebApp` calls `Bridge.tickEngine()`
2. `Bridge` (JS) calls `EngineBridge.Tick()` (C#)

C#
3. `EngineBridge` calls `PhysicsEngine.Tick()`
4. `PhysicsEngine` completes physics calculations
5. `EngineBridge` calls `MemoryBufferHandler.WriteTickData()`

Javascript
6. `Bridge` returns `BodyDiffData`
    - propagates errors marshalled from C# exceptions
    - reads from memory and refreshes the exposed `simState` object
    - returns an simple diff to `WebApp`, containing the ids of created, deleted, and updated bodies

### Error Handling Strategy
**Exception Translation**
- All C# exceptions are propagated to Javascript via WASM native marshalling to JS Error objects.
- Physics validation errors return descriptive error messages
- System exceptions return generic error indicators

**Graceful Degradation**
- Invalid operations return error responses but don't crash the simulation
- Critical tick errors pause the simulation with error display rather than silent failure
- Memory allocation failures trigger cleanup and retry mechanisms

---

## PhysicsEngine Architecture
The physics engine is designed as a completely UI-agnostic, self-contained system that provides a clean API boundary for external integration. This separation ensures the computational physics logic remains independent of presentation concerns and can be thoroughly tested in isolation.

### API
The PhysicsEngine is accessed by initializing the exposed `PhysicsEngine` class.
```csharp
public sealed class PhysicsEngine
{
    // Provides a live, direct, and read-only view into select properties of the simulation's state.
    SimulationView View { get; }

    // Advances the simulation by a single step.
    void Tick();

    // Loads a simulation with provided bodies from the given base data.
    void Import(
        SimDataBase sim,            // The base data for the simulation.
        List<BodyDataBase> bodies   // The base data for all the bodies.
    );

    // Gets a snapshot of the base data that makes up the current simulation.
    (SimDataBase sim, List<BodyDataBase> bodies) Export();

    // Creates a new celestial body in the simulation.
    // Returns the unique Id of the created body.
    int CreateBody();

    // Deletes a celestial body from the simulation.
    // Returns true if the specified body instance was found and removed, or false otherwise
    bool DeleteBody(
        int id          // The unique id of the body to delete.
    );

    // Atomically updates a celestial body in the simulation.
    // Returns true if the update was successful, or false otherwise.
    bool UpdateBody(
        int id,                     // The unique id of the body to update.
        BodyDataUpdates updates     // The new values for properties to be updated.
    );

    // Atomically updates the parameters of the simulation.
    void UpdateSimulation(
        SimDataUpdates updates      // The new values for properties to be updated.
    );
}
```

`SimulationView` provides a live, direct, and read-only view into select properties of the simulation's state. This data is transient, represents the current simulation state, and its values should not be cached.
```csharp
public sealed class SimulationView
{
    // The current timestamp of the simulation time in units of days (d).
    public double SimulationTime { get; }

    // The amount of time that passes in a single simulation step. In units of days (d). A negative timestep makes the simulation step backwards in time.
    public double TimeStep { get; }

    // The gravitational constant, in units of mÂ³/kg/sÂ².
    public double G_SI { get; }

    // The opening-angle parameter (theta, Î¸) for the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
    // A smaller theta value results in higher accuracy but more calculations, as tree nodes must be closer to be treated as a single mass. 
    // A larger theta value is faster but less accurate.
    // Default value is 0.5.
    public double Theta { get; }

    // The softening factor (epsilon, Îµ) used to prevent numerical instability.
    // Prevents the gravitational force from approaching infinity when two bodies get extremely close,
    // which would otherwise lead to simulation errors and unphysically large accelerations. 
    // Default value is 0.001.
    public double Epsilon { get; }

    // Provides a read-only list of views for every celestial body currently in the simulation.
    // Each BodyView in this list acts as a lightweight, live proxy to a body within the simulation.
    public abstract IReadOnlyList<BodyView> Bodies { get; }
}

// Provides a live, direct, and read-only view into select properties of a single celestial body's state.
// This data is transient, represents the current simulation state, and its values should not be cached.
public readonly struct BodyView
{
    // Unique ID of the body, which is always an integer >= 0
    public readonly int Id { get; }
    // A disabled body will be ignored by physics calculations.
    public readonly bool Enabled { get; }
    // The mass of the body in Solar Masses (Mâ˜‰).
    public readonly double Mass { get; }
    // The position of the body in Astronomical Units (au).
    public readonly Vector2D Position { get; }
    // The velocity vector of the body in Astronomical Units per day (au/d).
    public readonly Vector2D Velocity { get; }
    // The acceleration vector of the body in Astronomical Units per day squared (au/dÂ²).
    public readonly Vector2D Acceleration { get; }
}
```

Additionally the `Physics` namespace exposes the following records for write operations.
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The base data that defines a celestial body.
/// </summary>
public record BodyDataBase(int Id, bool Enabled, double Mass, double PosX, double PosY, double VelX, double VelY);

/// <summary>
/// Partial data to update a celestial body. Null values are ignored. 
/// </summary>
public record BodyDataUpdates(
    bool? Enabled = null,
    double? Mass = null,
    double? PosX = null,
    double? PosY = null,
    double? VelX = null,
    double? VelY = null,
    double? AccX = null,
    double? AccY = null
);

/// <summary>
/// The base data that defines a simulation.
/// </summary>
public record SimDataBase(
    double SimulationTime, double TimeStep, double Theta, double G_SI, double Epsilon
);

/// <summary>
/// Partial data to update a simulation. Null values are ignored. 
/// </summary>
public record SimDataUpdates(
    double? TimeStep = null,
    double? Theta = null,
    double? G_SI = null,
    double? Epsilon = null
);

```

- Simple circular celestial bodies (size based on mass)
- Mono-colored background and bodies
- Basic zoom and focus tracking on most massive body
- Play/pause simulation controls
- Default solar system preset
- Import/export preset functionality

**Phase 1 - Simulation Controls**
- Variable time scaling and speed controls
- Simulation time navigation (forward/backward)
- Adjustable gravitational constant
- Undo/redo system implementation

**Phase 2 - Body Management**
- Interactive celestial body list interface
- Add/remove body functionality
- Per-body configuration panel
- Real-time property info display
- Body-specific controls (focus, delete)

**Phase 3 - Visual Polish**
- Orbit path visualization
- Velocity trail rendering
- Body labels
- System-wide camera view with center of gravity focus
- Smooth camera transitions
- Visual customization options
- Background color selection

**Testing Approach**
- Unit tests for physics calculations and data management
- Automated integration testing via Playwright
- Additional manual testing for UI components and user interactions

**Timeline:** 40 hours/week development schedule, open-ended duration (learning project; too many known and unknown unknowns to estimate)
